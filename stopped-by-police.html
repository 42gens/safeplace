    <h3 class="placard-title">Your fundamental rights</h3>
    <ul class="placard-content">
      <li>You have the right to remain silent. For example, you do not have to answer any questions about where you are going, where you are traveling from, what you are doing, or where you live. If you wish to exercise your right to remain silent, say so out loud. (In some states, you may be required to provide your name if asked to identify yourself, and an officer may arrest you for refusing to do so.)</li><br>
      <li>You do not have to consent to a search of yourself or your belongings, but police may pat down your clothing if they suspect a weapon. Note that refusing consent may not stop the officer from carrying out the search against your will, but making a timely objection before or during the search can help preserve your rights in any later legal proceeding.</li><br>
      <li>If you are arrested by police, you have the right to a government-appointed lawyer if you cannot afford one.</li><br>
      <li>You do not have to answer questions about where you were born, whether you are a U.S. citizen, or how you entered the country. (Separate rules apply at international borders and airports as well as for individuals on certain nonimmigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers.</li><br>

    <h3 class="placard-title">Recording the Police and the First Amendment	- Sourced from NOLO</h3>
   <ul class="placard-content">
    <li>Most courts agree that the First Amendment gives you the right to record—with pictures, video, and audio—police officers who are on duty in public. Although the First Amendment doesn't say we have a right to record the police, it does give us the rights of free speech and a free press. It also provides the right to gather information about our government.</li><br>
    <li>Smartphones have made it easy for most people to instantly start filming anything or anyone, including the police. As more news is gathered and shared this way, many courts have found that freedom of the press applies to citizen journalists just as it does to formal members of the press. Courts have also found that recording police activity helps the public monitor the police, address officer misconduct, and protect civil liberties.</li><br>

        <h2>Three Ways to Invoke the Right to Remain Silent</h2>
        <li>“I am exercising my right to remain silent.”</li>
        <li>“I will not speak until I talk with my attorney.”</li>
        <li>“I am invoking my Miranda rights.”</li>

        <h3>Your rights</h3>
        <li>Both drivers and passengers have the right to remain silent.</li>
        <li>If you’re a passenger, you can ask if you’re free to leave. If yes, you may silently leave.</li>
        <h3>Key Note</h3>
        <li>Courts have admitted the paradoxical nature of the right to remain silent – an individual must verbalize that they are invoking their right to remain silent.</li>

        <h3>How to reduce risk to yourself</h3>
        
            <li>Stop the car in a safe place as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>Turn off the car, turn on the internal light, open the window part way, and place your hands on the wheel. If you’re in the passenger seat, put your hands on the dashboard.</li>
            <li>Upon request, show police your driver’s license, registration, and proof of insurance.</li>
            <li>Avoid making sudden movements, and keep your hands where the officer can see them.</li>
        
        <h3>What to do if you are arrested or detained</h3>
        
            <li>Say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately. Don &#8217;t give any explanations or excuses. Don &#8217;t say anything, sign anything, or make any decisions without a lawyer.</li>
            <li>If you have been arrested by police, you have the right to make a local phone call. The police cannot listen if you call a lawyer. They can and often will listen to a call made to anyone else.</li>
        
        <h3>If you believe your rights were violated</h3>
        
            <li>Write down everything you remember, including officers’ badges and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, and any other details. Get contact information for witnesses.</li>
            <li>If you’re injured, seek medical attention immediately and take photographs of your injuries.</li>
            <li>File a written complaint with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board. In most cases, you can file a complaint anonymously if you wish.</li>

    <h3 class="placard-title">The police are at my door</h3>
    <ul class="placard-content">
        <h3>Your rights and how to reduce risk to yourself</h3>
            <li>You should not invite the officer into your house. Talk with the officers through the door and ask them to show you identification. You do not have to let them in unless they can show you a warrant signed by a judicial officer that lists your address as a place to be searched or that has your name on it as the subject of an arrest warrant .</li><br>
            <li>Ask the officer to slip the warrant under the door or hold it up to the window so you can read it. A search warrant allows police to enter the address listed on the warrant, but officers can only search the areas and for the items listed. An arrest warrant has the name of the person to be arrested.</li><br>
            <li>Even if officers have a warrant, you have the right to remain silent. You should not answer questions or speak to the officers while they are in your house conducting their search. Stand silently and observe what they do, where they go, and what they take. Write down everything you observed as soon as you can.</li>
        
        <h3>When your rights have been violated</h3>
        
            <li>Write down everything you remember, including officers &#8217;badge and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, and any other details. Get contact information for witnesses.</li><br>
            <li>File a written complaint with the agency &#8217;s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board. In most cases, you can file a complaint anonymously if you wish.</li>
        
        <h3>How to be a responsible bystander</h3>
        
            <li>If you are a guest inside the house and end up answering the door, you should make clear to the police that you are a guest and do not have the authority to let them inside without the homeowner’s permission.</li>

    <h3 class="placard-title">How to reduce risk to yourself</h3>
    <ul class="placard-content">
      <li>Stay calm. Don’t run, resist, or obstruct the officers. Do not lie or give false documents. Keep your hands where the police can see them.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>


<div style="background-color: #e6ffe6;" class="placard" onclick="toggleContent(this)">
    <h3 class="placard-title">What you can do if you think you’re witnessing police abuse or brutality</h3>
    <ul class="placard-content">
        <li>Stand at a safe distance and, if possible, use your phone to record video of what is happening. As long as you do not interfere with what the officers are doing and do not stand close enough to obstruct their movements, you have the right to observe and record events that are plainly visible in public spaces.</li>
        <li>
            Do not try to hide the fact that you are recording. Police officers do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when performing their jobs, but the people they are interacting with may have privacy rights that would require you to notify them of the recording.
            you must affirmatively make people aware that you are recording them.
        </li>
        <li>Police officers may not confiscate or demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, and they may not delete your photographs or video under any circumstances. If an officer orders you to stop recording or orders you to hand over your phone, you should politely but firmly tell the officer that you do not consent to doing so, and remind the officer that taking photographs or video is your right under the First Amendment. Be aware that some officers may arrest you for refusing to comply even though their orders are illegal. The arrest would be unlawful, but you will need to weigh the personal risks of arrest (including the risk that officer may search you upon arrest) against the value of continuing to record.</li>
        <li>Whether or not you are able to record everything, make sure to write down everything you remember, including officers’ badge and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, how many officers were present and what their names were, any use of weapons (including less-lethal weapons such as Tasers or batons), and any injuries suffered by the person stopped. If you are able to speak to the person stopped by police after the police leave, they may find your contact information helpful in case they decide to file a complaint or pursue a lawsuit against the officers.</li>
